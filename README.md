# Differential-Equations
A differential equation is an equation that relates a function with one or more of its derivatives. They are used to model various phenomena in physics, engineering, and other fields, including population growth, heat flow, and radioactive decay. Differential equations are a fundamental part of mathematics and engineering, used to describe how quantities change over time. The main chapter on differential equations typically covers these core topics:

* **[Introduction to Differential Equations](./Introduction_to_Differential_Equations.ipynb)** – Definition, order, and degree of differential equations.

* **[First-Order Differential Equations](./First-Order_Differential_Equations.ipynb)** – Methods like separation of variables, integrating factors, and exact equations.

* **Second-Order Differential Equations** – Homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases, characteristic equations, and applications.

* **Higher-Order Differential Equations** – Extending concepts to third-order and beyond.

* **Laplace Transform** – Using transforms to solve differential equations efficiently.

* **Systems of Differential Equations** – Solving multiple equations simultaneously.

* **Numerical Methods** – Approximate solutions using Euler’s method and Runge-Kutta techniques.

* **Applications** – Real-world problems in physics, engineering, and economics.
